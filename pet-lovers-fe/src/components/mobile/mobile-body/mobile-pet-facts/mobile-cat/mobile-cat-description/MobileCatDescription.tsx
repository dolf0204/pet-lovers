      <p>
        Cats have been domesticated for around 4,000 years. While they were once
        valued for their hunting abilities, they are now valued for their
        companionship and loving behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        While not well known, the collective nouns used for cats and kittens are
        a clowder of cats and a kindle of kittens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our domestic cats are known as little cats. They differ from large cats
        such as lions and tigers because they are naturally active at night and
        can purr.
      </p>
      <p>Cats are now the most popular pet in the UK and in the US.</p>
